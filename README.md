# homepage-feature
This is a theme component that features topics on your Discourse community's homepage.
By default the theme will feature the 5 most recent topics tagged featured and will pull in the first image from the topic. In the settings you can choose a custom tag, hide the tag, set a custom title, and configure where the component appears.
